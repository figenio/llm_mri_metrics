# llm_mri_metrics
Repo dedicated to the development of metrics to analyze LLMs activation patterns obtained from the LLM-MRI library.

**Note of use**: this project was developed with the use of python venv in mind, especially because the dependencies involved only function on python 3.11.

## File organization

The project is divided into two sections, one for validating the mappings generated by the LLM-MRI library, and the second is dedicated to obtain and evaluate the metrics with which assess LLMs in regards to expertise.

For validating the mappings, the files are:

- `evaluation-sumary.ipynb`: summarizes the results of the classifiers into simpler tables with mean and variance of the f-score results for each model x mapping pairing;
- `evaluation-exploring.ipynb`: analyses the summarized results and plots the visualizations; 

No arquivo de evaluation-sumary.ipynb são definidos os métodos que obtêm tanto o mapeamento quanto os valores de embedding e os convertem para uma tabela em que a primeira coluna é o label do documento e o resto das colunas representa os valores de ativação (em mapeamento ou embedding) para aquele documento.

For the activation graphs metrics, the files are:
- `compiling_graphs.ipynb`: dedicated to compile the generated graphs for every combination of label, dimension and model.  Resuming all the processing in this file, avoids having to recompile all graphs for the development of new metrics and methods;`
- `compiling_metrics.ipynb`: computes the metrics for every generated graphs, it defines a `LLM_metrics` class that stores all metrics methods;
- `exploring_summary.ipynb`: analyses the computed metrics and plots visualiztions;
